# 8BIT Wave Backplate

The backplate is mainly just a piece of PCB intended to cover up the underside of the module, this way the user does not necessarily have to feel like they're handling exposed electronics. For the most part the most voltage going through the thing is 9 volt so the risk is low, but I find it safer this way since I don't have to worry about the surface I'm placing it on (a few vintage computers have metal cases).

# 1> Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as both a schematic and as a  starting point for ordering PCBs (basically you could just zip the contents of the export folder and upload that on a fabrication site), the schematic is also available in [PDF-format](https://github.com/tebl/8BIT-Wave/tree/master/documentation/schematic) found within the schematics-part of the [documentation](https://github.com/tebl/8BIT-Wave/tree/master/documentation).

# 2> BOM
Most parts should be easy to get a hold of from your favourite local electronic component shop, but given that I don't have access to such shops where I live so everything was based on whatever I could get cheapest from eBay/AliExpress (free shipping, plan on waiting 3-4 weeks for delivery though).
